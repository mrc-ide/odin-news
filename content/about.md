This news site covers the researcher-facing part of the odin stack, covering:

* [odin](https://mrc-ide.github.io/odin), our DSL for dynamical models
* [dust](https://mrc-ide.github.io/dust), a high-performance parallel simulation engine
* [mode](https://mrc-ide.github.io/mode), a parallel ODE engine, soon to be merged into `dust`
* [odin.dust](https://mrc-ide.github.io/odin.dust), transpilation support for odin models to `dust` and `mode`
* [mcstate](https://mrc-ide.github.io/mcstate), statistical support for `dust` and `mode` models, implementing particle filtering, particle MCMC, and other algorithms.

This stack was built by us at [RESIDE](https://reside-ic.github.io) to support research activities within the [MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/).
